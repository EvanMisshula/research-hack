          <h2>The first ever Queens College Research Sprint</h2>
          <p>The Queens College Center for Teaching and Learning presents the first ever Research Sprint.  Modeled on popular hackathons like NYC Big Apps and Mozilla Codesprint.  The QC Sprint seeks to bring students and faculty together in unprecedented colliagiality, openness and productivity.</p>
          <p>Faculty will pose problems to be solved by teams of undergraduate and masters' students working together using open source tools and Development techniques. Each faculty member registered will spend some time coaching each team working on thier problems both in person and remotely.  Students will spend the weekend building equipment, mobile apps or websites.</p>
          <p>On Sunday evening, at a ceremony attended hosted by President Matos-Rodriguez and attended by local dignataries such Assistant Mayor Alecia Glenn, NYC's first ever CTO Minerva Tantoco, NSF Program Managers and prominent NYC venture capitalists such Charlie O'Donnell of Brooklyn Bridge Ventures and Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures prizes will be awarded to most daring and creative projects.</p>
          <p>Prizes will include  space in the Queens College Tech incubator, mentoring by prominent business leaders and venture capitalists, NSF I-CORE training for commercialization of Research, Grants for research, guaranteed admission to C4Q's highly competative access code program and grants for open access publication. Celebrity judges include Vice-Chancellor for Research Gillian Small, Coalition For Queens Founder Jukay Hsu, VP of Time Inc. Shameel Arjun, Director of the Mozilla Open Science Lab Kaitlyn Thaney, CUNY Grad Center Computer Science Executive Officer Robert Haralick and Free Software Pioneer Richard Stallman. </p>

          <h2>Students</h2>
          <p>The best students know that college is much more than a collection of classes or a degree.  It is a chance to push boundaries.  It is your place to make a difference.  Research universities have been pushing the boundaries of knowledge since the Middle Ages.  Now it is time for you to put your programming, design, mobile and web development skills to use to do more than promote a party.  Solve real reseach problems with your professors.</p>
          <p>Computational skills and thinking are among the most valued skills both by graduate schools and employers.  Degrees, badges and certifications matter less and less every day.  Show future employers and colleagues that you are way more than your GPA. </p>
          <p>Everyone wants a team player.  What better way to show them you are than spending a weekend using git to work on a project with your friends and a mentor.  What is like to collaborate on real science.  It isn't real science if you know for sure what the answer is.  Practice your professional presentation skills.</p>
          <p>Did we mention prizes? There is mentorship with prominent Venture Capitalists, training by the NSF in commercializating research, grants for attendance at scientific and free computing conferences. It doesn't stop there because we have free web hosting prizes and Google watches. </p>

          <h2>Faculty</h2>
          <p>Get your hands on the best students at Queens.  These students can code web sites, mobile apps and handle large volumes of distributed data.  Many of them have had internships with NYC start ups through TTP and CUNY Tech Prep.  These programs provide additional expensive training in web and mobile development. Since these students also diversify the Research pipeline, many times they can bring additional Resources and focus to your important research.</p>
          <p>The Queens College Research Sprint needs faculty to submit important but small buiding blocks to your research.  Teams of students will work on solving these problems during the sprint. You will review their efforts and submit a form prior to the award ceremony on Sunday evening.</p>
          <p>Prizes for faculty are centered on several themes, advancing research at Queens College, increasing openness and accessability of research and increasing reproducibility by incorporating best practices of free software development including version control, testing and provable code. </p>
          <p>Prizes include conference fees, support for research</p>
